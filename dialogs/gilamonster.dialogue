Me: The wasteland is thick with radioactive dust… are you okay?  
Gila Monster: Barely hanging on.  

Me: You… who are you?  
Gila Monster: I’m the Gila monster, North America’s largest venomous lizard, we lived in the desert shrubs of Arizona and Sonora.  
Gila Monster: Now, in this post‐apocalyptic aftermath, even the cracks between rocks glow, and radiation is devouring our last refuges.  

Me: What do you think of people calling you a “monster”?  
Gila Monster: They only judge by appearance, never realizing that what flows through my veins is a miracle forged by millions of years of nature.  

Me: What kind of miracle?  
Gila Monster: In my venom lives a peptide called exendin-4. 
Gila Monster: Decades ago, scientists isolated it from me and turned it into the diabetes drug Byetta®. 
Gila Monster: Humsn synthesize it in bulk. 
Gila Monster: yet have almost forgotten to show their gratitude.  

Me: So you do have value…  
Gila Monster: Yes. We’ve helped advance medicine. But as our habitat is carved up, our numbers have fallen to “Near Threatened,” with fewer than a few hundred left in the wild.  
Gila Monster: Roads and towns slice through our desert home, many of my kin are killed on highways; others are illegally hunted because they fear our looks. 
Gila Monster: The real “monsters” are those who take life without thought.

Me: How can I help you survive?  
Gila Monster: In this nuclear ash, protecting every inch of desert is vital. 
Gila Monster: Tell other survivors: deserts need law and respect.  
Gila Monster: No more capturing, no more destroying our burrows; support conservation efforts so that this barren land still holds pockets of life.  

Me: I will make sure more people hear your voice.  
Gila Monster: Thank you. Remember: when the world is destroyed by radiation and greed, its chance to be reborn depends on whether you refuse to become the true “monster.”
